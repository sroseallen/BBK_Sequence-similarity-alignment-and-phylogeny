# Package Details
This is a package designed to compare an input DNA sequence, compare its similarity to a database of dog breed DNA sequences, and output the following results:

1) The most similar sequence found in the dog breed database and a measure of how similar the sequence is

2) A list of all sequences in the database with a p-value estimating probability that the input sequence is an exact match to it

3) An adaptable phylogeny tree containing your input sequence and all sequences within the dog breed database.
